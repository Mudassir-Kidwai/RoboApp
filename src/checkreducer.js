//Redux Ducks Implementation
/*A moduleâ€¦
1. MUST export default a function called reducer()
2. MUST export its action creators as functions
3. MUST have action types in the form npm-module-or-app/reducer/ACTION_TYPE
4. MAY export its action types as UPPER_SNAKE_CASE, if an external reducer needs to listen for them, or if it is a published reusable library
